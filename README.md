# TODO App with Voice Reminder

This is a simple TODO application built with React that allows users to add tasks, set reminders, and mark tasks as completed. The app uses local storage to persist data, making it lightweight and easy to use without any backend server.

## Features

- Add tasks with a reminder time.
- Mark tasks as done or undone.
- Delete tasks.
- Voice reminders that alert you when a task is due.
- Data persists using local storage, so you won't lose your tasks when you refresh the page.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling**: CSS
